      <p> <br>  Stress, to me, means feeling helpless in tough situations. I get anxious quickly and find it hard to think clearly. 
        Sometimes I lose control over my thoughts and emotions. My confidence drops and I start overthinking everything.
        But now, I’m realizing stress isn’t my enemy. It’s my signal. It tells me something needs care, space, and attention.
        It’s something I’m still learning to manage.</p></div>

<div class="container">
     <p class="username"> Areas of Improvement </p>
      <p> <br> <centre>I have noticed that I easily get affected by overthinking, fear of failure, and poor time management. These habits increase my stress levels and disturb my focus. One major area where I need to improve is in handling emotional triggers calmly instead of reacting immediately. I also often skip rest or delay my meals during busy days, which affects both my physical and mental health. Learning to say no when needed, staying consistent with routines, and being kinder to myself are areas I really need to work on.</centre></p>
<!-- Future Change--> -->
<div class="container">
     <p class="username"> Future Change </p>
      <p> <br> <centre>Moving forward, I plan to apply the techniques I’ve learned in simple and consistent ways. I will start by setting daily priorities using a planner, practicing deep breathing when I feel anxious, and taking small breaks during long work sessions. I also want to include mindful activities like journaling, sky-watching, or talking to close friends to manage my emotions better. These positive habits will not only help reduce my stress but also improve my focus, confidence, and overall lifestyle.</centre></p>
